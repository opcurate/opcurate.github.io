        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Source and resource are two different words with totally different meanings. Source is a place or a thing that provides us what we are looking for. We go to school to obtain knowledge and to a college to obtain a degree. In this sense, these are sources of knowledge and degree for us. A well is a source of fresh underground water for us while the sun is a source of constant energy. There is another word resource that means something valuable for us and something that we consume to serve a function. This article attempts to differentiate between source and resource, to make readers use the right word in the right context.</p>

            <p>source和resource是两个不同的单词, 他们的意思完全不一样. </p>
            <p>ource是一个地方, 这个地方提供给我们想要的东西. 比如说 我们到学校去获取知识, 或者到大学去获取学位, 那里就是知识和学位的来源. 又或者说 井是我们地下水的来源, 太阳是能量的来源. 这些地方都叫做source. (资源的来源处)</p>
            <p>resource呢, 是一种对我们有价值的东西, 我们可以拿这个东西用来服务于我们. (资源)</p>
            <p>这篇文章尝试区分source和resource, 使读者明晰.</p>
    
        <h2>Source</h2>
            <p>Milk is a source of protein that we need to drink to fulfill our daily requirements of protein. Similarly, vegetables and fruits are sources of vitamins and minerals that our bodies require to fulfill its daily need of nutrients. We know then that we have to get to the source to find what we are looking for.</p>
            <p>A teacher is a source of knowledge while a sun is a source of energy. For a vehicle that runs on petrol, a petrol pump is the source of fuel to keep the vehicle running. Talking about energy, matter is the source of all energy, and matter is made up of atoms that constitute all energy.</p>
            <p><span class="a1">translate(chinese)</span></p>
            <p>牛奶是蛋白质的来源, 我们每天都需要蛋白质补充身体; </p>
            <p>蔬菜和水果是维他命和微量元素的来源, 我们每天都需要维他命和微量元素补充身体;</p>
            <p>我们需要得到这些东西(蛋白质, 维他命和微量元素)的来源.</p>
            <p>老师是知识的来源, 太阳是能量的来源.</p>
            <p>机器依靠汽油才能运行, 所以汽油是机器继续运转的来源.</p>
            <p>还有能量, 物质是一切能量的来源, 而物质由充满能量的原子组成.</p>

        <h2>Resource</h2>
            <p>Resources are things that are valuable to people or a nation for its development. Energy is the basis of all development, and this is why governments all over the world are looking for resources of energy that is renewable or reusable. Fossil fuels, of which petroleum is the most important, is found deep inside the earth and is one valuable resource of energy that we have been extracting at a fast pace that is not sustainable.</p>
            <p>People are another resource for development, and the population of a country is regarded as its natural resource that needs to be harnessed for development. Any organization works on the basis of its resources like men and machinery.</p>
            <p><span class="a1">translate(chinese)</span></p>
            <p>Resource 是一个东西, 这个东西对人们或者对一个民族的发展很有价值. 能量是所有发展的基础, 这也是为什么政府在全世界寻找新型可重复利用能量的来源.</p>
            <p>化石燃料, 其中石油是最重要的, 它在地球深处, 是一种有价值的能量资源, 我们正在以一种不可持续发展的方式 快节奏的开采他们</p>
            <p>人是另外一种发展的资源, 人口数量被视为国家的自然资源, 这个资源可以用于发展. 任何组织都在某种资源的基础上运作, 例如人或者机器. </p>

        <h3>Sources vs Resources</h3>
        <p>• Source is a place or a thing for a useful entity. We eat fruits and vegetables as they are sources of energy and vitamins and minerals for our bodies.</p>
        <p>• Resource is a valuable thing that is necessary for a people or a nation. Sun is a resource of renewable energy for us.</p>
        <p>• We are always on the lookout for sources of resources that are important for us.</p>
        <p>• People are also considered important and invaluable resource for any organization</p>
        <p>• Natural resources of a country are its mineral wealth, water bodies and fossil fuels</p>
        <p><span class="a1">translate(chinese)</span></p>
